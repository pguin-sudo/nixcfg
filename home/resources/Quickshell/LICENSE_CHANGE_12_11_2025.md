# DankMaterialShell License Change

Relicensing from GPL-3.0 to MIT.

Consent and documentation is available in [pull request #686](https://github.com/AvengeMedia/DankMaterialShell/pull/686) and is summarized below.

## Contributors

The project has 21 contributors requiring consent:
- 2 primary authors (10k+ lines each)
- 7 major contributors (1k+ lines or 10+ commits)
- 12 significant contributors (100+ lines)
- 2 derivative works (code adapted from other projects)

Contributors with <50 lines are excluded as they don't meet copyright thresholds. Automated bots don't hold copyright.

## Consent Status

All 21 contributors have provided consent. Three contributions were sufficiently reverted or rewritten by maintainers, making them eligible without original author consent.

## Reasoning

GPL-3.0 may require plugins to also be GPL-3.0 licensed. MIT allows plugin authors to choose their own licenses.
